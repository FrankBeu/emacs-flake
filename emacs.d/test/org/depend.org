#+TYP_TODO: TODO NEXT | DONE
#+STARTUP: nologdone
* 1
OK, here is the example.
** TODO Win a million in Las Vegas
  :PROPERTIES:
    :ID: I-cannot-do-it-without-money
  :END:

  The "third" TODO (see above) cannot become a TODO without this money.

** Do this by doing a chain of TODOs
*** NEXT This is the first in this chain
   :PROPERTIES:
     :TRIGGER: chain-siblings(NEXT)
   :END:
*** This is the second in this chain
*** This is the third in this chain
   :PROPERTIES:
     :BLOCKER: I-cannot-do-it-without-money
   :END:

*** This is the forth in this chain
   :PROPERTIES:
     :TRIGGER: XYZ-is-my-id(TODO)
   :END:

   When this is DONE, we will also trigger entry XYZ-is-my-id

*** This is the fifth in this chain

** Start writing report
   :PROPERTIES:
     :ID: XYZ-is-my-id
   :END:

Now in the following org file, try changing item TODO state to NEXT. You should see properties drawer appear with the TRIGGER property inside.

Try marking the NEXT item DONE. The next item should automatically become NEXT.

Change priority of one of the items to [#A], then mark the NEXT item DONE. The highest priority item will automatically become NEXT.


** Auto-NEXT example
*** TODO Make me NEXT, then mark me DONE
*** TODO Second item
*** TODO Third item
*** Plain item
*** TODO Change my priority
